# Snake Game Walkthrough

I have created a modern, neon-styled Snake game in a single HTML file.

## Features Implemented
- **Visuals**: Dark gradient background, glassmorphism UI, neon glow effects, and particle explosions.
- **Gameplay**: Smooth snake movement, special power-up food, progressive difficulty.
- **Audio**: Synthesized sound effects using Web Audio API (no external files).
- **Controls**: Keyboard (Arrow/WASD) and Touch (Swipe).
- **Responsiveness**: Adapts to screen size, works on mobile.

## Verification

I verified the game by running it in a browser environment.

### Start Screen
The game starts with a polished menu screen allowing difficulty selection.

### Gameplay
The game runs smoothly with the snake moving on the grid.
